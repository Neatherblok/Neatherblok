### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Ricardo de Deijn!

ðŸŽ“ Background:
I am a passionate Master's student in Data Science at Minnesota State University, Mankato, with a strong foundation in information and communication technology. Originally from The Netherlands, my academic journey includes a Bachelor's degree in Information and Communication Technology from HZ University of Applied Sciences in Middelburg. Currently pursuing a Master's degree, I am dedicated to exploring the vast possibilities at the intersection of data science and technology.

    ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on exploring the intersection of data science and technology in pursuit of a Master's degree in Data Science at Minnesota State University, Mankato. I'm actively engaged in diverse projects that enhance my skills in Python, SQL, R, and machine learning. I have recently been a part of a research group that has been researching several generative adversarial networks (GANs) and how the Signed Inception Distance (SID) metric can be used in addition to FrÃ©chet Inception Distance (FID) to evaluate these models.

    ðŸŒ± I'm currently deepening my knowledge in machine learning, statistical modeling, data mining, and deep learning. Actively seeking opportunities to apply and expand my skills in real-world scenarios.

    ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on exciting projects related to data science, machine learning, and innovative technologies. Open to collaborating with fellow enthusiasts and professionals who share a passion for leveraging data to drive meaningful insights.

    ðŸ¤” Looking for help with enhancing my expertise in algorithmic scaling and complexity. Interested in connecting with individuals who can offer insights into the latest advancements in deep learning for audio and digital signal processing.

    ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experience as a Junior Data Scientist, where I led a project to revamp data infrastructure and implemented object recognition models. Also, feel free to discuss my academic journey, volunteer experiences, or anything related to data science and technology.
